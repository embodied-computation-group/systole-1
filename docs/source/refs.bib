abstract = {This chapter presents the fundamental signal processing techniques used to analyze the PPG signal. The chapter starts by providing an overview of the PPG signal, covering its physiological origins, presentation, and acquisition. Fundamental signal processing techniques are then presented, covering: preprocessing techniques; analysis in the time and frequency domains; the application of machine learning; and methods to estimate physiological parameters from PPG signals. Finally, the chapter provides a review of methods to synthesize PPG signals.}
